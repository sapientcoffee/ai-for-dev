# Cymbal Coffee: The "Bean-to-Cup" Brainstorming Board ☕

## The "Spark" (Core Idea)
We want to build an app that acts as a digital barista. It reads your mood, serves up the perfect coffee recommendation, and gives you a little nugget of coffee wisdom to start your day right.

## 🎭 Feature 1: The Mood-to-Brew Matchmaker
*How are you feeling, and what should you be drinking?*

**Initial Thoughts:**
- User selects their current state of mind (Tired, Stressed, Happy).
- The app instantly recommends a beverage perfectly suited for that mood.

**"Double Shot" Ideas (Future Iterations):**
- **Expand the Moods:** Add states like "Creative" (pour-over), "Hangover" (cold brew with an extra shot), "Cozy" (mocha), or "Adventurous" (nitro cold brew).
- **Time of Day Context:** "Tired" at 8 AM = Triple shot Americano. "Tired" at 8 PM = Decaf Latte or Herbal Tea. 
- **The "Surprise Me" Button:** For the truly undecided.
- **Customizable Beans:** Ask the user if they prefer light, medium, or dark roasts before recommending.

## 💡 Feature 2: The "Daily Grind" Tip API
*A 'Coffee Tip of the Day' API endpoint displayed on the homepage.*

**Initial Thoughts:**
- A simple, random tip about coffee brewing or trivia on the homepage.

**"Double Shot" Ideas (Future Iterations):**
- **Category Tags:** Tips categorized by "Brewing Methods" (e.g., French Press ratios), "Trivia" (e.g., origin stories), or "Fun Facts".
- **Dynamic Content:** A public REST API (`/api/tips/daily`) that other devs can use to get coffee tips.
- **"Save for Later":** Allow users to favorite tips they want to try at home.

## 🎨 Vibe & Aesthetics (The "Cafe" Feel)
- **Color Palette:** Warm, earthy tones. Think roasted chestnut, creamy latte foam, and espresso black. 
- **Typography:** Modern, clean, but with a touch of artisan flair (like a chalk menu board).
- **Interactions:** 
    - The mood selector should be fun and bouncy. 
    - When a recommendation appears, maybe a little steam animation over a coffee cup icon.
- **Microcopy:** Instead of "Loading...", use "Brewing your recommendation..." or "Grinding beans..."

## 🚀 The MVP (Minimum Viable Pour) - What we are building NOW:
1. **Frontend:** Next.js application with a clean, responsive layout.
2. **Mood Selector:** 3 simple buttons:
   - 🥱 **Tired** -> ☕ **Espresso** ("Wake up and smell the coffee!")
   - 😫 **Stressed** -> 🍵 **Chamomile Tea** ("Take a deep breath. We've got you.")
   - 😄 **Happy** -> 🥤 **Frappuccino** ("Treat yourself!")
3. **Tip of the Day:** An API route (`/api/tip-of-the-day`) that returns a random string from a list of hardcoded tips.
4. **Display:** Show the tip prominently on the homepage alongside the mood selector.

## 📝 Backlog / "The Tip Jar" (Ideas for Later)
- Integration with local cafes (e.g., "Order this Espresso near you").
- User accounts to track their mood history and favorite drinks.
- "Share your mood" feature for social media.
- Sound effects (clinking mugs, coffee shop ambient noise toggle).
